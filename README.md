General Information
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables.
This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
Conclusions
High values of +ve coeeficients suggest a high sale value, some of features are top 5: -- GrLivArea, OverallQual, OverallCond, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFinSF1
High values of -ve coeeficients suggest a decrease in sale value, some of features are top 5: -- KitchenQual_TA, KitchenAbvGr, BsmtQual_TA, EnclosedPorch, MSSubClass
Market value of the property is less than the Predicted Sale Price then time to buy.
